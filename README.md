A web app adaptation of my workout program designed for personal use.



## about
This app is meant to provide a mobile friendly manner of navigating this workout program.

The routine was designed with full-body compounds as primary lifts and variations of these compounds as auxiliary lifts. Accessory lifts refer to those not closely related to primary lifts, and the addition of them is entirely up to user discretion. 

You choose how many days per week you want to lift. On a day, you do a fixed number of sets and take the last set to failure for any primary and/or auxiliary lifts, and the program automatically regulates load progressions based on performance.
